ClassHierarchyViewer
====================

This is a small application that I am making in C# which reads all .h files in a directory and creates a simple class
hierarchy from the class inheiritance. It's main use is to be able to see the class hierarchy in projects that have 
millions of lines of code and to be able to search those files efficiently for methods and member variables. As well
as being able to view the contents of said class easily.
